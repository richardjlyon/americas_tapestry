The Pennsylvania Panel depicts the activities of flag workers over 300
miles from each other in the Keystone State. Despite geographic
limitations, both Westmoreland County & Philadelphia were at the
forefront of the Revolution. The left side of the panel depicts the
fabrication of Westmoreland County’s “Don’t Tread On Me” Flag, which
can be viewed today at the Fort Pitt Museum in Point State Park. The
flag was flown by one of the first military units established west of
the Allegheny Mountains & features the native Pennsylvania rattlesnake
rendered into a political symbol by Benjamin Franklin.

On the right hand side of the panel, flag maker Rebecca Young works at
fabricating a flag for the Pennsylvania Navy. While the historical
record has designated Betsy Ross at the premier flag maker of the
Revolution, Philadelphia was comprised of many female business owners
who utilized their skills in service to the Revolution. During the
wartime years, Young was commissioned to make the Grand Union Flag
around 1775, designating her as one of the first verified flag makers
of a US Flag. In addition, she was paid for sewing a number of flags
for the Pennsylvania army & navy, along with military blankets & drum
cases.
