The Charlotte Museum of History was originally founded to be the steward of the 1774 Alexander Rock House and has since expanded its scope to cover all periods of Charlotte's history. The museum is centered around the ca. 1774 Hezekiah Alexander Home Site, a National Register of Historic Places site that is the oldest surviving house in Mecklenburg County and the last extant home of a framer of North Carolina's 1776 Constitution and Bill of Rights. Today, the Charlotte Museum of History preserves and interprets the past to build a better future with greater opportunity for all, offering audience-focused programs and exhibits that explore important civic themes and how their meaning has evolved over time, including ideals of liberty, freedom, equity, justice, democracy, and citizenship.
