The New York Tapestry celebrates the state's evolution from Dutch colony to cultural melting pot and commercial powerhouse. The panel illustrates New York's beginnings as New Amsterdam, its transfer to British control, its strategic importance during the Revolutionary War, and its emergence as America's gateway for immigration and commerce. The design weaves together the diverse threads of New York's story, from the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy to the waves of immigrants who transformed the state and nation.

The New York Panel is being created at the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](/team/historical-partners/#metropolitan-museum) in New York City, where visitors can observe the stitching process in the American Wing. The museum's world-class collections have provided rich inspiration for the design and techniques used in the panel.

Our New York Director is [Rebecca van Rensselaer](/team/state-directors/#rebecca-van-rensselaer), a textile conservator and historian who has brought together stitchers from across the state, including members of the New York Historical Society's textile program, the Hudson River Valley Art Workshops, and community groups from the five boroughs of New York City.

The tapestry highlights key moments and themes in New York's history, from the purchase of Manhattan to the Battle of Saratoga, the completion of the Erie Canal, and the rise of New York City as a global center of finance, arts, and culture. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of Native Americans, African Americans, and the waves of immigrants—Dutch, English, Irish, German, Italian, Jewish, Chinese, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and many others—who have shaped New York's unique identity as a cultural crossroads.
