Christmas in Odessa began 61 years ago as a fundraiser organized by the Women's Club of Odessa. Our purpose is to help fund college scholarships for local high school seniors. Together with the help and cooperation of Odessa homeowners, volunteers, and local businesses, we have provided over $300,000 in scholarships to over 200 students.

In addition, we have been able to contribute to many worthwhile community groups and projects. We are proud to make these contributions to our community, and we are fortunate to have the support of the many fine people who have encouraged us through the years.

Please visit our website at www.christmasinodessa.com for more information about this year's event including our 2nd Annual Gingerbread House Decorating Contest, and Town Tree Lighting ceremony.
