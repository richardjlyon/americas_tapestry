Catherine Theron has designed and taught counted thread pieces for over
30 years and has published designs under the name Theron Traditions.
She was also co-founder of The Gentle Art overdyed thread company. She
has been a member of EGA for 40 years and has just finished serving two
terms as President for her local chapter–Williamsburg Rose & Thistle.

Catherine has worked with needles and threads most of her life. She
remembers the needlework resurgence that occurred after our country’s
bicentennial and hopes that this tapestry project will spark another
stitching revolution with people of all ages and backgrounds. Having
the Virginia panel housed at the [Muscarelle Museum of Art](https://muscarelle.wm.edu/) on the
beautiful campus of William & Mary will be a delight!

She enjoys stitching with all who have embroidery knowledge and
expertise as well as teaching those who wish to participate.
