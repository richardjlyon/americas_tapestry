Rachel Genito, BFA Illustration â€˜26 is an illustrator from Hudson, New
York whose work explores the complexity of femininity, aging, and
identity. Working with digital mediums in an array of styles, Rachel is
focused on the power of portraiture and storytelling but has also been
looking to expand her work outwards to books, and paper sculptures. She
has recently worked in a variety of collaborative jobs with her work,
such as designing for a local Coffee Shop and working on editorial
work. She looks forward to her senior year and making even more work.

Rachel is deeply grateful for this incredible project and looks forward
to its continued progress!
