# Image Optimization Implementation Summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Updated

We've updated the following components to use Next.js's Image optimization:

1. **`blog-card.tsx`** - Blog post cards now use optimized images with proper sizing
2. **`featured-post.tsx`** - Featured blog posts now use the Image component with priority loading
3. **`tapestries/tapestry-card.tsx`** - Tapestry cards now use responsive images with proper z-indexing
4. **`sponsor-card.tsx`** - Sponsor logos are now properly optimized
5. **`team/person-card.tsx`** - Team member photos use the Image component with appropriate sizing
6. **`full-image-viewer.tsx`** - Interactive image viewer optimized for both cropped and full views
7. **`support/support-merchandise.tsx`** - Merchandise images now use proper optimization

## üìù Configuration Changes

1. **Next.js Config**
   - Enabled built-in image optimization 
   - Added output: 'standalone' for Vercel
   - Excluded content files from serverless bundle with outputFileTracingExcludes
   - Configured responsive image sizes

2. **Vercel Config**
   - Added vercel.json to ensure proper caching and routing
   - Set up content directory static asset handling

3. **Build Process**
   - Removed image copy script from build process
   - Created video-only copy script for video files
   - Simplified build pipeline

## üîß Utility Functions

Created image utility functions in `lib/image-utils.ts`:

1. **`getImagePath()`** - Standardizes image paths across the application
2. **`getVideoPath()`** - Handles video path transformations
3. **`getImageSizes()`** - Provides responsive sizing based on image role
4. **`customImageLoader()`** - Custom loader for advanced use cases

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Reduced Serverless Function Size** - Images and large media files are excluded from function bundles
2. **Faster Builds** - No more copying large files during build
3. **Better Performance** - Images are automatically optimized and served in modern formats
4. **Responsive Images** - Proper sizing and optimization for all device sizes
5. **Layout Stability** - Reduced layout shifts during page load

## üì± Mobile Improvements

- Responsive sizes for all image components
- Proper aspect ratios maintained
- Optimized image delivery for mobile networks
- Faster loading times on mobile devices

## üîç Next Steps

1. Continue updating any remaining components with HTML `<img>` tags
2. Consider implementing Blur placeholders for faster perceived loading
3. Test performance improvements with Lighthouse scores
4. Fine-tune image quality settings if needed
5. Explore advanced optimization strategies for particularly large images

## üìä Expected Improvements

- 25-50% reduction in image sizes through modern format conversion
- Significantly faster page load times
- Better Core Web Vitals scores
- More efficient caching and delivery
- Easier maintenance with standardized image handling
