The Rehoboth Beach Museum was founded in 1975 by the Rehoboth Beach Historical Society to exhibit artifacts that illustrate the development of the community. The museum features the history of beach culture through vintage bathing suits, postcards, photos, and maps that bring to life Delaware's beloved coastal community since 1873.
