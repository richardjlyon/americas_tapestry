Jenni Paperman is the New York panel director and resides in Niskayuna, NY. Jenni began stitching while in college as a means of crafting handmade gifts for friends and family. While she has used a number of different stitches on the New York panel, Jenni has especially enjoyed working in blackwork. The subject matter of the state panel has been of particular interest to Jenni, who had not been previously familiar with the Birch Trials or the role of Fraunces Tavern during the American Revolution. Looking ahead to our next 250 years, Jenni hopes that all citizens have the opportunity to celebrate our country as part of community, much like the community that has been formed through the America's Tapestry project.
