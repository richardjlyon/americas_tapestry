The Pennsylvania Tapestry celebrates the state's central role in the founding of America and its rich cultural and industrial heritage. The panel depicts William Penn's "Holy Experiment" in religious tolerance, the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, and the state's transformation through the industrial revolution. The design weaves together the diverse threads of Pennsylvania's story, from the Lenape and Delaware tribes to the Quakers, Germans, Scots-Irish, and many others who shaped the state's identity.

The Pennsylvania Panel is being created at the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](/team/historical-partners/#philadelphia-museum-of-art), where visitors can observe the stitching process in the American Wing. The museum's extensive collection of Pennsylvania German textiles, Quaker samplers, and industrial-era artifacts has provided rich inspiration for the design and techniques used in the panel.

Our Pennsylvania Director is [Sarah Miller](/team/state-directors/#sarah-miller), a textile artist and historian who has brought together stitchers from across the Commonwealth, including members of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen, the Mennonite Heritage Center, and the Pittsburgh Embroidery Guild.

The tapestry highlights key moments and themes in Pennsylvania's history, from the founding of Philadelphia in 1682 to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the growth of industry in Pittsburgh and the anthracite coal region, and the state's leadership in art, science, and education. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of women, African Americans, and immigrant communities to Pennsylvania's development.
