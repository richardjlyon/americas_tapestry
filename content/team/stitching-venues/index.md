Our stitching venues represent a remarkable collection of America's most distinguished cultural institutions, from historic houses and museums to libraries and cultural centers spanning thirteen states. These prestigious venues serve as both hosts and partners, providing authentic historical settings where embroiderers gather to create the America's Tapestry while surrounded by the very artifacts and stories that inspire their work. Each venue brings its unique expertise in preservation, education, and community engagement, transforming the act of stitching into a powerful bridge between our revolutionary past and present-day civic participation.
