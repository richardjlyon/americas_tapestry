Our lovely State Directors serve as the regional leaders for America's Tapestry, each responsible for coordinating the creation of their state's panel and engaging local communities in the project. These talented individuals bring deep knowledge of their state's history and cultural traditions, along with expertise in textile arts and community organizing.

Working with local historical societies, museums, and community groups, they gather stories and design elements that authentically represent their state's unique contribution to America's cultural tapestry.
