You're an experienced front-end developer and Tailwind designer. The current website needs a makeover. It's been designed by someone who has not got a good visual eye. It implements a complicated system for section spacing and layout. There's inconsistent treatment of content on the pages. It's hard to maintain.

Issues:

1. **vertical separation**  There's a very complex system for having different types of vertical separation of section types. This doesn't seem to be consistently used nor is it easy to understand, and it should be rationalised.

2. **text copntainers** For example, on the about page http://localhost:3000/about, information is contained within a div that looks like parchment. But On the tapestry description page http://localhost:3000/tapestries/massachusetts The text is simply placed in a full-width box. Formatting is different again in the news article page. http://localhost:3000/news/may-2025-update With inconsistent styling, particularly with the title of the page. Overall design should in general be optimised for readability. Text should appear in some box which is distinct from the background and which has a width that aids readability. Which means updating the tapestry description page


Summary:

The goal of this stage is to critically review the structural layout Tailwind styling And create a robust, simple, and maintainable system that creates nice, clean output.
