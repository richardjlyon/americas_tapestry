**It's March - that means spring is almost here! I hope everyone is well
and enjoying the early signs of the changing season.**

This month, we have finalized the designs for the [New York](/tapestries/new-york), [New
Hampshire](/tapestries/new-hampshire), & [Virginia](/tapestries/virginia) Panels and traced the illustrations onto linen.
Our state directors are now preparing these panels to be stitched. Stay
tuned for further updates!

Last week, stitchers assembled at the [Atlanta History Center](https://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/) to begin
work on the Georgia Tapestry Panel. This was the inaugural meeting of
the project & we are so grateful for the team Deborah Berger and Robin
Starnes have assembled. We cannot wait to see what magic they create
over the next 14 months.

**March Spotlight - The New Hampshire Panel**

This panel illustrates [New Hampshire’s](/tapestries/new-hampshire) role at the forefront of
independence, depicting the Pine Tree Riot of 1772 which was one of the
first major disputes of royal authority.

The lower left hand vignette pays tribute to the raid of Fort William & Mary in 1774. Considered one of the first significant armed attacks of the American Revolution, the raid set the stage for future conflict with Great Britain. The gunpowder & cannons seized from the fort were distributed across the colonies and utilized at the Battle of Bunker Hill the following year.

The upper portion of the panel depicts the role of the Coosuk Abenaki band in defending the vulnerable Northern border, which was subject to frequent conflict. Lieutenant Timothy Bedel established strong ties to this Abenaki Community of Coos, New Hampshire, on the Connecticut River to facilitate recruitment of members to the Patriot cause. Despite its history as a frequent war zone between the French & British for supremacy of the territory, these Coosuk band members retained their foothold in a land with significant spiritual and economic importance to their people. Through his promise of material support and protection, Bedel recruited soldiers & scouts.

The panel features Lieutenant Bedel and Chief Philip, an Abenaki Patriot, deep in discussion. Despite their significant contribution to the Revolution, these Abenaki were denied protection in their homeland after the Revolution as fellow Patriots seized territory belonging to the tribe. Philip and his tribal citizens remained along with the settlers as he worked to secure hunting, fishing and planting rights for future generations.

The New Hampshire Panel was designed by illustrator [Elizabeth Long]() and
is being stitched at various locations including the New Hampshire
Historical Society in Concord, where visitors can observe the stitching
process within the context of the museum’s collection.

Our New Hampshire State Director is Carol Tewes Ganse, who has
assembled a team of stitchers from throughout the state.

**What's Next?**

Another busy month is ahead! We are preparing the Pennsylvania &
Connecticut Panels to be sent out to their respective organizations.
All designs for the remaining states are being finalized over the next
four weeks. Be on the lookout for more beautiful artwork from our
illustrators!

As your state begins preparations to receive your panel, [let me know]() if
you need any framing materials.

**Attention - State Director Needed!**

While we have been astounded at the number of stitchers and leaders who
have come forward from across the 13 states, we are still in need of a
State Director for Delaware.

If you think you know the right person, please get in touch! This can
be a shared role, and does not have to be time intensive.

That's all for this month - happy stitching!
