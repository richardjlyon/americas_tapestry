The Glenshaw Public Library proudly holds the distinction of being "the oldest free library west of the Alleghenies." Established in 1895 by Reverend J.T.R. Currie of the Glenshaw Valley Presbyterian Church, the library was founded through community collaboration, with church and community members collecting donated books and raising funds for its establishment. Reverend Currie served as the library's first librarian, personally selecting and cataloguing all the books in the collection. 

Located in Pennsylvania, the library continues to serve its community today while maintaining its historic significance as one of the region's oldest free libraries. The library currently hosts community programs including the Pennsylvania branch of America's Tapestry needlework project, where members of the public are invited to participate on Thursday evenings.
