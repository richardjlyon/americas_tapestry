# Exhibitions feature

This feture adds an "Exhibitions" between "Team" and "News" in the navbar. We will create a single page that displays information about exhibition venues. Venues are stored at content/exhibitions. Images are stored at public/images/exhibitions

Create a card for each exhibition, one per row. See visual-guide-exhibitions.jpg for layout. Use existing stylings for font, weight, and size where appropriate (e.g. "More Informaton ->")

IMPORTANT: use serena mcp for code examination. use playwright mcp to validate design
