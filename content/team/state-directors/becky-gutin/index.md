Becky began stitching with a stamped cross-stitch while in elementary school. Thanks to her sister, she began stitching counted cross-stitch in 1983, and hasn't looked back. Fiber arts run in the family - she has one sister who quilts and another who is a kiltmaker.

Becky became a member of Cyberstitchers (online) and Lamplighters (Woodstown, NJ) EGA chapters, and the Delaware Valley Historic Sampler Guild during COVID. In addition to counted cross-stitch, she has been known to stitch counted canvas/bargello and various forms of whitework/pulled and drawn thread and other assorted surface embroidery. She enjoys taking classes out of her comfort zone (Hardanger, Schwalm, beading, mixed media, goldwork and more). She looks forward to working with stitchers on the Delaware panel.
