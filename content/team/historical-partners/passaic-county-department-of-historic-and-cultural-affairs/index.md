Passaic County Department of Historic and Cultural Affairs (DCHA) plays
a critical role in community engagement and historical consultation for
the New Jersey panel as well as serving as an exhibition venue for the
completed Tapestry. DCHA is responsible for county-based historical
preservation projects and operates historical sites, including museums
and archives that hold artifacts and documents from the Revolutionary
War period. Their ongoing work in promoting local history through
educational programs and public events equips them with a deep
understanding of the area’s historical and cultural dynamics. The
department’s extensive network within the local community and its
experience in managing cultural projects makes it an ideal
collaborator. By leveraging DCHA’s resources and expertise, America’s
Tapestry benefits from a grounded, locally-informed perspective that
honors the specific historical contributions of New Jersey, enhancing
the overall richness and educational value of the project.
