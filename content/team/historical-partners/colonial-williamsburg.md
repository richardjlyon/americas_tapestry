The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation joined America's Tapestry as a historical partner in 2020, bringing its expertise in early American crafts and material culture to the project. As the world's largest living history museum, Colonial Williamsburg offers a unique perspective on the textile traditions of America's colonial and revolutionary periods.

The foundation's textile artisans, who practice historical weaving, dyeing, and needlework techniques using period-appropriate tools and materials, serve as consultants for America's Tapestry, advising on historical accuracy and demonstrating traditional methods. The Virginia panel, in particular, has benefited from this collaboration, incorporating motifs and techniques that would have been familiar to 18th-century Virginians.

Colonial Williamsburg's extensive collections of historical textiles, including quilts, embroidered samplers, and imported fabrics, provide valuable reference materials for America's Tapestry designers. The foundation's historians and curators also contribute their expertise on the social and cultural contexts of early American textile production, helping to tell the stories of both elite needleworkers and enslaved textile workers whose labor was essential to colonial society.

Public programs at Colonial Williamsburg regularly feature America's Tapestry, with demonstrations and workshops that allow visitors to try their hand at the stitching techniques used in the project. These programs emphasize the continuity between historical textile traditions and contemporary fiber arts, showing how America's Tapestry builds on centuries of needlework practice.
