William Smith, Massachusetts State Director for America's Tapestry, brings a deep knowledge of New England's textile history to his role. A descendant of mill workers who labored in the textile factories of Lowell in the 19th century, William has a personal connection to the region's industrial heritage that informs his approach to the Massachusetts panel.

With a background in both historical research and textile conservation, William earned his PhD in American History from Harvard University, where his dissertation examined the role of textile production in shaping New England's economy and society. Before joining America's Tapestry, he served as the Curator of Textiles at the Massachusetts Historical Society and taught courses on material culture at Boston University.

As State Director, William has focused on creating connections between Massachusetts' revolutionary past and its innovative present. The Massachusetts panel incorporates elements from the state's earliest colonial settlements, its role in the American Revolution and abolitionist movement, its industrial heyday, and its current position as a center for education and technology.

William has established partnerships with historical societies throughout the state, as well as with academic institutions like the American Textile History Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. These collaborations have allowed the project to access historical textiles and documents that provide authentic inspiration for the Massachusetts panel.
