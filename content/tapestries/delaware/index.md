The Delaware Tapestry honors the state's distinction as the first to ratify the U.S. Constitution on December 7, 1787. The panel illustrates Delaware's colonial origins as New Sweden and later as part of William Penn's holdings, alongside its pivotal role in America's founding. The rich imagery captures the state's diverse cultural influences and maritime traditions along the Delaware River and Bay.

The Delaware Panel is being created at the [Delaware Historical Society](/team/historical-partners/#delaware-historical-society), where visitors can observe the stitching process and learn about the state's unique history. The society's extensive collection of historical documents and artifacts has provided valuable reference material for the design of the panel.

Our Delaware Director is [Thomas Richardson](/team/state-directors/#thomas-richardson), a textile historian and curator who has assembled a diverse team of stitchers from across the state. The panel incorporates traditional techniques that reflect Delaware's multicultural heritage, including Swedish, Dutch, English, and Lenape influences.

The tapestry highlights key moments in Delaware's history, from the establishment of Fort Christina in 1638 to the state's crucial vote for independence in 1776, and its leadership in ratifying the Constitution. Special attention has been paid to representing the state's early industries, including shipbuilding, milling, and agriculture.
