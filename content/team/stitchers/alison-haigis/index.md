Alison Haigis is an embroiderer on the Connecticut tapestry panel. A resident of Tolland, Ct, she has been stitching for about 40 years. Having learned embroidery from her mother, she has practiced quilting and surface embroidery techniques. While working on the panel, Alison has utilized an outline stitch for many different motifs. Enjoying community service projects, she was inspired to join a project that involved communities from different states. Looking forward 250 years, she hopes that the US government continues to work for all the people that make up our nation.
