St. Paul's Lutheran Church is located in Hainesport, New Jersey, and describes itself as a community called by God to be "a community of peace and reconciliation." Founded in 1867, St. Paul's is one of the oldest Lutheran churches in New Jersey. The church actively serves both locally and globally, maintaining partnerships with the Rancocas Valley Clergy Association in Mount Holly and Bridge of Peace Community Church in Camden, while supporting ELCA World Hunger and Disaster Response efforts worldwide. 

St. Paul's demonstrates its commitment to community service through various outreach programs, including annual Thanksgiving food basket donations to needy families and youth mission trips to places like New Orleans. As an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) congregation, St. Paul's serves Burlington County and the surrounding region under pastoral leadership.
