America's Tapestry is proud to be partnered and affiliated with several state 250 commissions who are integral to planning each state's commemorative events for our upcoming 250th anniversary.

Through our collaboration with state 250 commissions, historical organizations, and local communities nationwide, we are creating a lasting artistic record of America's founding that will educate and inspire future generations while celebrating our shared heritage during this momentous milestone in American history.
