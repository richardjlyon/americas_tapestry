The Noah Webster House in West Hartford, Connecticut, is the birthplace and boyhood home of Noah Webster Jr., known as the "Father of American Language" and a founding father, educator, author, and lexicographer. The house was once part of a 120-acre farm and was continuously occupied until it was given to the town of West Hartford in 1962. Opening as a museum in 1966, the house is now a National Historic Landmark that contains several items with Webster associations, including early editions of his Dictionary of the American Language and Blue-backed Spellers, as well as personal belongings like china, glassware, a desk, and two clocks he owned as an adult.
