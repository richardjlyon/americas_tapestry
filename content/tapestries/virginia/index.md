The Virginia Tapestry celebrates the state's foundational role in American history as the site of the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown in 1607 and the birthplace of representative democracy in the New World. The panel illustrates key historical moments from the establishment of the House of Burgesses in 1619 to Virginia's central role in the American Revolution and the early republic.

The Virginia Panel is being created at the [Colonial Williamsburg Foundation](/team/historical-partners/#colonial-williamsburg), where artisans practice historical textile techniques using period-appropriate tools and materials. The foundation's expertise in early American crafts and material culture ensures historical accuracy in both the imagery and the techniques used to create the tapestry.

Our Virginia Director is [Elizabeth Jameson](/team/state-directors/#elizabeth-jameson), a textile historian with the Virginia Historical Society. Elizabeth has assembled a diverse team of stitchers from across the Commonwealth, including members of the Virginia Quilt Museum, the Embroiderers' Guild of America's Richmond chapter, and faculty from the textile arts program at Virginia Commonwealth University.

The panel incorporates motifs and techniques that would have been familiar to 18th-century Virginians, including elements inspired by surviving textiles from Monticello, Mount Vernon, and other historic Virginia homes. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of all Virginians, including indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, and women, whose stories are often overlooked in traditional historical narratives.
