The Maryland Tapestry celebrates the state's founding as a haven for religious tolerance and its rich Chesapeake Bay heritage. The panel illustrates Maryland's establishment by Cecil Calvert, Lord Baltimore, as a refuge for Catholics in 1634, its later adoption of the Toleration Act of 1649, and its evolution through the colonial period to its crucial role in the American Revolution and the War of 1812.

The Maryland Panel is being created at the [Maryland Historical Society](/team/historical-partners/#maryland-historical-society) in Baltimore, where visitors can observe the stitching process and engage with the state's history. The society's extensive collection of maritime artifacts, colonial furniture, and historical textiles has provided valuable reference material for the design of the panel.

Our Maryland Director is [Catherine Howard](/team/state-directors/#catherine-howard), a textile artist and historian specializing in Chesapeake Bay traditions. She has assembled a diverse team of stitchers from across the state, including members of the Chesapeake Needlework Guild and the Baltimore Embroidery Circle.

The tapestry highlights key moments in Maryland's history, from the landing of the Ark and the Dove at St. Clement's Island to the writing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" during the bombardment of Fort McHenry. It also celebrates the state's agricultural and maritime traditions, including tobacco farming, shipbuilding, and the distinctive culture of the Chesapeake watermen. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of Native Americans, African Americans, and the diverse religious communities that have shaped Maryland's identity.
