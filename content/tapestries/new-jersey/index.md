The state design features the many roles New Jersey women undertook
during the Revolution, including raising a phenomenal $15,000 for the
patriot cause. Our historical advisor, [Passaic County Department of
Cultural and Historical
Affairs](https://americastapestry.com/team/historical-partners/#dcha),
conducted a significant amount of research on the fascinating lives of
those living in the Dey Mansion in Passaic County. Famously, the Dey
Family hosted Generals Lafayette and Washington at the Mansion in 1780.

Our New Jersey Directors are Carol Prevost and Kiki Lar. The stitching
will be conducted by members of the Colonial West EGA Chapter in
partnership with the Princeton EGA Chapter. With their combined
artistry and exceptional skill, we cannot wait to see this come
together! They are stitching at St. Paulâ€™s Lutheran Church in
Lumberton.
