Becky Gutin lives in Wilmington, Delaware. She is the co-state director of the Delaware panel. Becky learned counted cross stitch from her sister 42 years ago when she moved back to Baltimore. She has used a number of stitches on the Delaware panel including the herringbone, cross-stitch, crewel, and wave stitch. The wave stitch is a particular favorite of Beckys as it renders the water of the Delaware Bay extremely well.

While working on America's Tapestry, Becky has been amazed at the number of fascinating stories that exist in our history that are not well known. As she looks towards our country's next 250 years, Becky hopes that we remain a fabulous, important, and caring nation.
