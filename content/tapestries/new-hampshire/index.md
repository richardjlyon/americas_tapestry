The New Hampshire Tapestry celebrates the state's pioneering
revolutionary spirit.

The panel illustrates New Hampshire’s role at the forefront of
independence, depicting the Pine Tree Riot of 1772 which was one of the
first major disputes of royal authority. The lower left hand vignette
pays tribute to the raid of Fort William & Mary in 1774. Considered one
of the first significant armed attacks of the American Revolution, the
raid set the stage for future conflict with Great Britain. The
gunpowder & cannons seized from the fort were distributed across the
colonies and utilized at the Battle of Bunker Hill the following year.

The upper portion of the panel depicts the role of the Coosuk Abenaki band in defending the vulnerable Northern border, which was subject to frequent conflict. Lieutenant Timothy Bedel established strong ties to this Abenaki Community of Coos, New Hampshire, on the Connecticut River to facilitate recruitment of members to the Patriot cause. Despite its history as a frequent war zone between the French & British for supremacy of the territory, these Coosuk band members retained their foothold in a land with significant spiritual and economic importance to their people. Through his promise of material support and protection, Bedel recruited soldiers & scouts. The panel features Lieutenant Bedel and Chief Philip, an Abenaki Patriot, deep in discussion. Despite their significant contribution to the Revolution, these Abenaki were denied protection in their homeland after the Revolution as fellow Patriots seized territory belonging to the tribe. Philip and his tribal citizens remained along with the settlers as he worked to secure hunting, fishing and planting rights for future generations.

The New Hampshire Panel is being created at the Millyard Museum in Manchester, where visitors can observe the stitching
process within the context of the museum’s vast collection.

Our New Hampshire State Co-Directors are Carol Tewes Ganse & Michelle McPheron, needleworkers
who have assembled a team of stitchers from throughout the state.
