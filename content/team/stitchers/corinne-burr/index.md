Corinne Burr is an embroiderer on the North Carolina tapestry panel. A resident of Raleigh, she has been stitching for about 5 years. Having learned embroidery through a book on thread painting purchased at a thrift store, Corinne has practiced cross stitch, surface embroidery including crewel, and raised embroidery. While working on the panel, Corinne has utilized a whipped running stitch, smyrna stitch, and a simple Darning stitch. Of those the Smyrna/Double Cross stitch is her favorite! Corinne is really looking forward to the couching work that is planned for future areas on the panel. A California native, Corinne has deeply enjoyed learning more about the history of North Carolina while working on the tapestry. She was particularly excited to work on a large community project such as America's Tapestry after reading "The Threads of Life" by Claire Hunter, which discussed impactful needlework projects such as the Great Tapestry of Scotland.
