Laura Kasowitz is the owner of [Hartford
Stitch](https://www.hartfordstitch.com/), a sewing, fiber, and textile
art school in West Hartford, CT where she shares her love of sewing,
needlework, and fiber crafts with children and adults.

She believes that handcrafts are not only practical and creative, but
empowering. Knowledge of these crafts gives us an opportunity to
connect with our own abilities, each other, and those who came before
us. Alongside classes, she has organized community sewing events and
intergenerational sewing programs.
