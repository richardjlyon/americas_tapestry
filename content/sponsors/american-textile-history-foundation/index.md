The American Textile History Foundation became a Silver-level sponsor of America's Tapestry in 2021, bringing specialized expertise in textile preservation, documentation, and historical research to our project. Following the closure of the American Textile History Museum in 2016, the Foundation continues the museum's educational mission through grants and partnerships with organizations like ours.

## Partnership Highlights

The Foundation's support has enhanced America's Tapestry in several key areas:

- Providing specialized funding for the documentation and preservation of our completed tapestry panels
- Offering access to their extensive digital archive of historical American textiles for research
- Supporting the development of our online educational resources about textile techniques
- Connecting our project with textile experts and conservators across the country

## About the American Textile History Foundation

The American Textile History Foundation preserves the legacy of the American Textile History Museum by supporting educational initiatives, research, and public programs related to America's textile heritage. Through grants, partnerships, and its digital collections, the Foundation ensures that the rich history of American textile production and craft continues to be accessible to scholars, students, and the public.

The Foundation's specialized focus on textile history and preservation makes it a particularly valuable partner for America's Tapestry, providing both financial support and expert guidance on the technical aspects of our work.
