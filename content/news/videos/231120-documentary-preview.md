## About the Documentary

"Threads of a Nation" is a feature-length documentary that chronicles the creation of America's Tapestry from its inception to the completion of the first seven state panels. Directed by award-winning filmmaker Sarah Johnson, the film offers unprecedented behind-the-scenes access to the artists, historians, and community members bringing this monumental project to life.

The documentary explores:

- The initial vision and planning stages of the project
- The research process for each state panel
- The collaborative design process between historians and artists
- The communities of stitchers working together across the country
- The technical challenges and innovations in contemporary textile art
- The personal stories of individuals whose heritage is represented in the tapestries

## Film Festival Circuit

Before its public release, "Threads of a Nation" will premiere at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in May 2024 and will be featured at several film festivals, including:

- American Documentary Film Festival (April 2024)

## Educational Distribution

Following its festival run and public release, the documentary will be made available to educational institutions along with curriculum materials for art, history, and cultural studies programs. A series of shorter segments focused on specific aspects of the project will also be produced for classroom use.

## Production Team

The documentary is being produced by Heritage Film Collective in association with the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Textile History Foundation. The production team has been following the project since 2021, documenting key moments in the creation of each state panel and conducting interviews with participants across the country.
