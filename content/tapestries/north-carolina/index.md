The North Carolina tapestry panel illustrates the Edenton Tea Party, a significant
moment early in the Revolutionary movement.

The panel depicts a group of women gathered outside the Chowan County Courthouse in 1774 debating
and discussing a document symbolizing their political resolve. The event is considered one
of the earliest recorded instances of organized political actions by women in the American
colonies.

The Edenton Tea Party was organized by Penelope Barker and involved 51 women who signed a
resolution to boycott British goods including tea and textiles. This act was in protest of the
Tea Act of 1773 and other oppressive measures imposed by the British Crown. The women pledged
their support for the resolutions passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress, which aimed to
resist British taxation without representation

The resolution, known as the "Edenton Resolves," declared the women's commitment to abstain
from British imports until unjust laws were repealed. It emphasized their duty to protect
the "safety and happiness" of their county and demonstrated their solidarity with broader
colonial resistance efforts.

While ridiculed in England through satirical cartoons, it was celebrated in the colonies
as an act of patriotism. These women not only supported the revolutionary cause but placed
themselves at great risk by publicly asserting their political agency.
