The South County Museum was founded in 1933 in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The museum found its current home at Canonchet Farm in 1985, located on an eight-acre campus within a 174-acre town park that was once the 19th-century estate of Rhode Island's Civil War-era governor and postwar senator, William Sprague IV. The museum has been preserving and interpreting "the history of the farm, village, and sea since 1933," showcasing Rhode Island's coastal legacy and rural heritage. Visitors can explore a living history farm, flower gardens, and walking trails through woods, meadows, and salt marshes, experiencing firsthand the rich historical heritage of rural and coastal life in southern Rhode Island.
