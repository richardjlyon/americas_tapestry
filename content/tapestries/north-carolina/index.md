The North Carolina Tapestry celebrates the state's journey from the mysterious Lost Colony of Roanoke to the Wright Brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk. The panel illustrates North Carolina's development from early English settlements to its role in the American Revolution, including the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, often cited as the first declaration of independence from British rule. The design captures the state's diverse geography, from the Outer Banks to the Piedmont to the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The North Carolina Panel is being created at the [North Carolina Museum of History](/team/historical-partners/#north-carolina-museum) in Raleigh, where visitors can observe the stitching process and engage with the state's rich history. The museum's extensive collections have provided valuable reference material for the design of the panel.

Our North Carolina Director is [Martha Graham](/team/state-directors/#martha-graham), a textile artist and educator who has assembled a diverse team of stitchers from across the state. The panel incorporates techniques that reflect North Carolina's multicultural heritage, including Cherokee basket patterns, Scots-Irish weaving traditions, and African American quilting motifs.

The tapestry highlights key moments in North Carolina's history, from the establishment of the first English colony in America on Roanoke Island to the state's reluctant secession from the Union and its subsequent reconciliation and growth. It also celebrates the state's natural resources, from the longleaf pine forests that provided naval stores for the British Empire to the tobacco and textile industries that drove economic development in the 19th and 20th centuries. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of Native Americans, African Americans, and the diverse European settlers who shaped North Carolina's distinctive regions and traditions.
