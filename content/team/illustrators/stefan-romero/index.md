Stefan Romero is the visionary founder of _America's Tapestry_. With
conservatory training in visual and theatrical arts, Stefan oversees
the design of each state embroidery panel. Fascinated with the
intersection between archival inquiry and sartorial significance,
Stefan is committed to telling stories that can only be told through
textile-based sources.

His costume design work has been seen on stage and film. As a Fulbright
Scholar at the University of Glasgow, Stefan studied Dress and Textiles
where he assisted on an exhibition in the Borders Region of Scotland,
traveled to London to work on a period film set, and examined diaries
at the archives of the University of Georgia. Stefan is excited to see
where his work takes him next.
