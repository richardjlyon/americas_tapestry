The Delaware 250 Commission seeks to tell the full and honest story of Delaware's past that extends before 1776 and continues to the present day. Their mission centers on allowing more people to see themselves reflected in Delaware's history by acknowledging the plurality of histories within both the state and nation.

The Commission frames 1776 as a beginning rather than an end of the American story, emphasizing the ongoing pursuit of creating a more perfect union. They aim to cultivate deeper appreciation for Delaware's history among residents and visitors, encouraging thoughtful consideration of the past to inspire future generations.
