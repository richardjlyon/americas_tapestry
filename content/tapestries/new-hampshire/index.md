The New Hampshire Tapestry celebrates the state's revolutionary spirit and its distinctive natural landscape. The panel illustrates New Hampshire's development from early settlements at Portsmouth and Dover to its bold action as the first colony to establish an independent government in January 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence. The design captures both the state's colonial heritage and its iconic natural features, from the seacoast to the White Mountains.

The New Hampshire Panel is being created at the [Strawbery Banke Museum](/team/historical-partners/#strawbery-banke-museum) in Portsmouth, where visitors can observe the stitching process within the context of the museum's preserved colonial neighborhood. The museum's collection of historical textiles and artifacts has provided valuable reference material for the design of the panel.

Our New Hampshire Director is [Jonathan Prescott](/team/state-directors/#jonathan-prescott), a textile artist and historian who has assembled a team of stitchers from throughout the state. The panel incorporates traditional New England needlework techniques, including crewel embroidery and whitework that would have been familiar to colonial New Hampshire women.

The tapestry highlights key moments in New Hampshire's history, from the establishment of Fort William and Mary to the capture of its gunpowder by colonists in December 1774â€”one of the first acts of armed rebellion against British authority. It also celebrates the state's natural beauty, maritime traditions, and later industrial development in mill towns like Manchester and Nashua. Special attention has been paid to representing the Abenaki people and their continuing presence in the region, as well as the state's tradition of political independence embodied in its motto, "Live Free or Die."
