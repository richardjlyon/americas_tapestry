The New Hampshire Tapestry celebrates the state's pioneering
revolutionary spirit.

The panel illustrates New Hampshire’s role at the forefront of
independence, depicting the Pine Tree Riot of 1772 which was one of the
first major disputes of royal authority. The lower left hand vignette
pays tribute to the raid of Fort William & Mary in 1774. Considered one
of the first significant armed attacks of the American Revolution, the
raid set the stage for future conflict with Great Britain. The
gunpowder & cannons seized from the fort were distributed across the
colonies and utilized at the Battle of Bunker Hill the following year.

The upper portion of the panel depicts the role of the Abenaki tribe in
defending the vulnerable Northern border, which was site to continual
conflict with enemy tribes & Canadian encroachment. Lieutenant Timothy
Bedel established strong ties to the Abenaki Community of Coos, New
Hampshire, on the Connecticut River in the hopes of recruiting members
to the Patriot cause. Despite its history as a frequent war zone
between the French & British for supremacy of the territory, the
Abenaki retained their foothold in a land with significant spiritual
and economic importance to their people. Through his promise of
material support and protection, Bedel was able to recruit warriors &
scouts who chose to relocate to the lower Coos. The panel features
Lieutenant Bedel and Chief Philip, an Abenaki Patriot, deep in
discussion. Despite their significant contribution to the Revolution,
the Abenaki were denied protection in their homeland after the
Revolution as fellow Patriots illegally seized territory belonging to
the tribe.

The New Hampshire Panel is being created at the New Hampshire
Historical Society in Concord, where visitors can observe the stitching
process within the context of the museum’s vast collection.

Our New Hampshire State Director is Carol Tewes Ganse, a needleworker
who has assembled a team of stitchers from throughout the state.
