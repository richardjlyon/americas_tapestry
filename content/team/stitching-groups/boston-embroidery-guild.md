The Boston Embroidery Guild has been a vital contributor to America's Tapestry, taking primary responsibility for the stitching of the Massachusetts panel. Founded in 1982, the Guild brings together embroiderers of all skill levels who are dedicated to preserving and advancing the art of needlework in its many forms.

With 35 active members ranging from professional textile artists to enthusiastic amateurs, the Guild represents a diverse community united by their passion for needlework. Many members bring decades of experience in various embroidery techniques, including crewel, blackwork, goldwork, and silk shading, all of which have been incorporated into their work on the Massachusetts panel.

The Guild meets weekly at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, where members work collaboratively on sections of the tapestry under the guidance of master embroiderers. Their work on the Massachusetts panel has focused on depicting the state's rich intellectual and revolutionary heritage, from the founding of Harvard University to the events of the American Revolution.

Beyond their technical expertise, Guild members have contributed valuable research on historical needlework traditions in New England, drawing inspiration from the museum's collection of colonial-era samplers and embroidered pictures. This research has informed both the design and the execution of the Massachusetts panel, ensuring its historical authenticity.

The Guild also conducts public demonstrations and workshops related to America's Tapestry, sharing their skills with the broader community and recruiting new stitchers to participate in the project.
