The Rhode Island Tapestry celebrates the state's founding principles of religious liberty and its rich maritime heritage. The panel illustrates Rhode Island's establishment by Roger Williams in 1636 as a refuge for those persecuted for their religious beliefs, its early adoption of religious freedom and separation of church and state, and its development as a center of maritime trade and later industrial innovation. Despite being the smallest state, Rhode Island has had an outsized influence on American ideals of liberty and justice.

The Rhode Island Panel is being created at the [Rhode Island School of Design Museum](/team/historical-partners/#risd-museum) in Providence, where visitors can observe the stitching process and engage with the state's artistic traditions. The museum's renowned textile collection has provided valuable inspiration for the design and techniques used in the panel.

Our Rhode Island Director is [Prudence Brown](/team/state-directors/#prudence-brown), a textile artist and historian who has assembled a diverse team of stitchers from across the state, including faculty and students from the RISD Textile Department, members of the Newport Historical Society, and community groups from Providence, Newport, and Narragansett.

The tapestry highlights key moments in Rhode Island's history, from Williams' founding of Providence to the burning of the British customs ship Gaspee in 1772—one of the first acts of rebellion against British authority. It also celebrates the state's maritime traditions, including the Triangle Trade and whaling, and its later industrial revolution sparked by Samuel Slater's mill in Pawtucket. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of the Narragansett and Wampanoag peoples, African Americans both free and enslaved, and the diverse religious communities—Baptists, Quakers, Jews, and others—who found refuge in the "lively experiment" of Rhode Island.
