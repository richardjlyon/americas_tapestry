Our Stitching Groups are the collectives of skilled needleworkers who bring the tapestry designs to life through traditional techniques. These groups range from established embroidery guilds with decades of experience to community-based collectives representing diverse cultural traditions. 

Working collaboratively, they transform illustrations into textile art, applying a wide range of stitching techniques from various cultural traditions. Beyond their technical contributions, these groups serve as community hubs, engaging the public through demonstrations, workshops, and storytelling sessions.
