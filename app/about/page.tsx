                    On July 4th 2026, our nation will commemorate the
                    250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
                    All over the United States, communities will be holding events to
                    illustrate and mark our unique history, and to look forward to our next
                    250 years.

                    Organizing one such event is 27 year-old artist and researcher Stefan
                    Romero. Stefan is a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University's
                    prestigious College of Fine Arts, where he specialized in the dress and
                    textiles of Colonial America. As a Fulbright Scholar, Stefan deepened
                    his understanding of the discipline through his Masters Degree at the
                    University of Glasgow in Scotland.

                    In collaboration with William & Mary (VA), Seton Hill University (PA),
                    and a number of carefully selected historical and craft organizations,
                    Stefan is creating a unique exhibition: "America's Tapestry".

                    The exhibition features 13 hand embroidered panels, one for each of the
                    original colonies. The embroidery will be conducted by talented
                    artisans from New Hampshire to Georgia. The panels illustrate the
                    diverse stories of individual contributions–many overlooked–that reveal
                    each colony's struggle for Independence. Historical associations from
                    across the states have volunteered to collaborate on the panels'
                    historical imagery and have generously agreed to host the stitchers as
                    they work.

                    The idea came to me while on a work assignment in Europe after visiting
                    'The Great Tapestry of Scotland'", says Stefan. "I was deeply moved by
                    the richness and drama of Scotland's story as it unfolded from panel to
                    panel. As the product of many talented individuals working across the
                    country to create a harmonious whole, it seemed to characterize one of
                    the defining features of the American experiment.

                    Stefan will be working with chapters of the Embroidery Guild of America
                    across the Eastern Seaboard to embroider the panels. After the
                    inaugural display at William & Mary's historic campus–a stone's throw
                    away from Colonial Williamsburg, "America's Tapestry" will tour a
                    number of other historic venues throughout the East Coast.

                    While many talented volunteers have already come forward to stitch the
                    panels, a project of this magnitude requires considerable manpower.
                    Interested EGA members are encouraged to volunteer to work on this
                    historic project. Each panel will be stitched from July 2025 to June
                    2026 at a historic institution within the original 13 states. All
                    materials will be provided.

                    It is a privilege for me to represent our Nation with a needlework
                    project that will be a legacy product of this historic occasion. As we
                    look forward to our next 250 years, it is more important than ever to
                    preserve a definitive art form that has contributed so much to our
                    country's distinct artistic identity.
