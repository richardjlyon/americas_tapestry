This evocative artwork captures a pivotal moment in the American Revolution, highlighting the heroism of Major Henry Fisher, known as the "eyes and ears" of the Revolution. Fisher is depicted firing a signal gun, alerting Patriot forces to the approach of an enemy ship near the Delaware Bay. A steadfast patriot from Lewes, Delaware, Fisher played a critical role in safeguarding the Delaware River and its surrounding areas from British incursions. He raised and funded an army of 100 soldiers to defend the Cape and the Bay, often using his own resources to provide meals and care for ill soldiers. 

Fisher also collaborated with the Cape Henlopen Lighthouse keeper to establish a system of signals for early warnings of enemy movements. His innovative tactics included creating a "circuit riding" intelligence network to expedite communication with Philadelphia and employing underwater defenses, such as cheveaux de frise, to damage enemy ships. This painting vividly portrays Fisher’s dedication and ingenuity as he works to protect the colonies’ vital waterways during the fight for independence.
