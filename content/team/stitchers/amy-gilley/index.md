Amy Gilley resides in Wilmington, DE and is the co-director of the Delaware panel. She began stitching about 30 years ago when she began purchasing needlework kits. Shortly after, Amy began to take classes in embroidery. While cross stitch remains a favorite of Amy's, she has practiced beading, cross stitch, canvas work, and counted work. So far, Amy has had the opportunity to stitch on the Delaware and the Pennsylvania tapestry panel. 

While embroidering on the Delaware panel, she has utilized the herringbone, stem, cross stitch, half cross, straight, and crewel stitch. With a deep love for the United States, Amy is thrilled to be working on America's Tapestry, particularly a project of this size. Since joining, Amy has learned a great deal about Revolutionary history, including that there was more than one Tea Party during the Revolution! Amy looks forward to watching communities come together through next year's celebration and beyond.
