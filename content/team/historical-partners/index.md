Our Historical Partners are the prestigious museums, archives, and
cultural institutions that provide America's Tapestry with historical
expertise, research resources, and exhibition spaces. These
partnerships ensure that our tapestries are grounded in rigorous
historical scholarship while reaching broad audiences.

By hosting public programs and workshops, these institutions play a
vital role in both the creation and presentation of America's Tapestry.
