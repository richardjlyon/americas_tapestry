Susan Banbury is a resident of Indian Land, South Carolina and embroiders on her state's panel. An active stitcher for about 50 years, Susan learned embroidery from her Aunt and later from the Embroiderers' Guild of America. Susan has explored many needlework techniques throughout her practice, including cross stitch, counted work, pulled or drawn thread embroidery, surface embroidery, and lace making. So far, Susan has used smyrna, seed, French knot, buttonhole, and chain stitching on the panel. Looking forward to our nation's anniversary, Susan hopes that we all come together to celebrate this major milestone.
