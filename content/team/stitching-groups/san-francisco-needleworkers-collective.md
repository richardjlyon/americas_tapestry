The San Francisco Needleworkers Collective brings a contemporary, community-based approach to their work on America's Tapestry's California panel. Founded in 2010 as an inclusive space for textile artists of all backgrounds, the Collective emphasizes the social and political dimensions of needlework, using traditional techniques to address contemporary issues.

With 42 members representing the Bay Area's diverse communities, the Collective brings multiple cultural perspectives to their work on the California panel. Members include practitioners of Chinese silk embroidery, Mexican bordado, Filipino pina work, and numerous other cultural traditions, creating a truly multicultural approach to the tapestry.

The Collective meets in rotating locations throughout San Francisco, from the de Young Museum to community centers in the Mission District and Chinatown. This mobile approach allows them to engage with different communities and incorporate local perspectives into their work. Their sections of the California panel reflect the state's complex history, from indigenous cultures and Spanish missions to the Gold Rush, the transcontinental railroad, and Silicon Valley.

Beyond their technical contributions, the Collective has organized community story-gathering sessions throughout California, collecting narratives that inform both the content and the design of the tapestry. These sessions have been particularly successful in engaging immigrant communities and ensuring that their experiences are represented in the final work.

The Collective also maintains an active educational program, offering workshops in schools and community centers that teach basic needlework skills while discussing the themes of cultural heritage and diversity that are central to America's Tapestry.
