The Butler-McCook House & Garden, built in 1782, is Hartford's oldest house and the only 18th-century home remaining on Hartford's Main Street. For 189 years, the house was home to four generations of the Butler-McCook family who recorded the evolution of Main Street between the American Revolution and the mid-twentieth century. This extraordinary family included physicians, industrialists, missionaries, artists, globetrotters, and pioneering educators and social reformers who filled the home with original furnishings ranging from Connecticut-crafted colonial furniture to Victorian-era toys, paintings, and samurai armor acquired during travels to Japan.  Now operated by Connecticut Landmarks, the Butler-McCook family also helped preserve the nearby Amos Bull House in their backyard, which currently serves as the organization's headquarters.
