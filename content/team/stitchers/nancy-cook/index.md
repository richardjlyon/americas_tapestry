Nancy lives in Charlotte, NC and embroiders on the South Carolina tapestry panel. An active stitcher for over 50 years, Nancy primarily practices embroidery with metal threads, including the beautiful (and challenging!) practice of goldwork. This image is an incredible example of her accomplished skill in multimedia projects & raised embroidery. She first learned to embroider in the Brownies program and with the help of her grandmother.

She has used a variety of stitches on the South Carolina panel, including the chain, split, & buttonhole stitch. She joined our project out of friendship and a desire to support embroidery arts. While working on the tapestry, Nancy has learned more about the role of camp followers during the American Revolution.
