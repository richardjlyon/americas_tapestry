The Connecticut 250 Commission was established to plan Connecticut's commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, focusing on inclusive celebrations that honor the state's full history while building toward a shared future.

Their core mission emphasizes grassroots civic engagement that makes all residents—regardless of background—feel represented and included in the American story. The Commission’s work encompasses historical education, cultural preservation, tourism development, and creating opportunities for civic engagement that reach across all of Connecticut's communities.
