The Smithsonian Institution has been a cornerstone partner of America's Tapestry since the project's inception in 2019. As the nation's largest museum and research complex, the Smithsonian brings unparalleled resources and expertise to the project, providing access to its vast collections of historical textiles, documents, and artifacts that inform the design and content of each tapestry panel.

The collaboration is centered at the National Museum of American History, where curators from the Division of Home and Community Life work closely with America's Tapestry designers to ensure historical accuracy and cultural sensitivity. The museum's extensive collection of quilts, samplers, and other textiles from across American history serves as both inspiration and reference for the project's artists and stitchers.

In addition to providing research support, the Smithsonian hosts regular public programs related to America's Tapestry, including lectures, workshops, and demonstrations that allow visitors to engage with the project and learn about traditional textile techniques. The museum's Textile Conservation Laboratory also provides technical advice on materials and preservation methods, ensuring that the tapestries will endure as lasting cultural artifacts.

The partnership extends to the Smithsonian's community engagement initiatives, with America's Tapestry participating in the museum's annual Folklife Festival and contributing to educational outreach programs that bring textile arts to schools and community centers throughout the country.
