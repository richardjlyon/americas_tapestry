Joan Flanigan-Clarke is an embroiderer on the Delaware tapestry panel. A resident of Millsboro, she has been stitching since she was 5 years old. Joan has practiced cross stitch, quilting, including piecework and appliqué, and knitting. While working on the panel, Joan has utilized Bargello, satin, and running stitch. Having recently discovered through genealogy that she has ancestors who fought in the American Revolution, Joan decided to honor her family's patriotism through her participation in this project. While working on America's Tapestry, Joan has discovered many hidden stories from our nation's past.
