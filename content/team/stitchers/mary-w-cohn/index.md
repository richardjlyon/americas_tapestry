Mary W. Cohn is an embroiderer on the North Carolina tapestry panel. A resident of Raleigh, she has been stitching for over 50 years. Having learn embroidery at a young age through Elizabethan style crewel pillow kits purchased for her by her mother, Mary has since practiced cross stitch, counted work that isn't cross stitch, pulled or drawn thread embroidery, quilting, including piecework and appliqu√©, surface embroidery including crewel, raised embroidery, and knitting. While working on the panel, Mary has utilized smyrna cross stitch. Mary was drawn to America's Tapestry out of a desire to be a part of a large historical project. She has greatly enjoyed learning about the Edenton Tea Party, which is the event depicted in her state panel.
