The Rhode Island Historical Society was selected to collaborate due to
its extensive expertise and commitment to preserving and interpreting
Rhode Island’s rich history. This organization is pivotal for its deep
archival resources and active engagement in promoting Rhode Island’s
historical narratives, which makes it an essential partner for a
project focused on weaving the state’s diverse historical threads into
a comprehensive artistic depiction. They provide crucial archival
materials and scholarly insights, drawing from their extensive
collections that encompass a range of artifacts, documents, and
artworks from the colonial period through the Revolutionary War.
Additionally, the Society plays an active role in community outreach
and engagement, organizing educational programs and exhibitions related
to the tapestry project at their facilities, which include the John
Brown House Museum and the Museum of Work & Culture.
