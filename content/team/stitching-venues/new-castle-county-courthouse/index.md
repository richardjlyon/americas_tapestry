The New Castle Court House was built in 1732 as the statehouse for Pennsylvania's "Three Lower Counties on the Delaware" and served as Delaware's first court house and eventually state capitol. The original central section was constructed over the remains of Delaware's first courthouse from 1689, with two small wings added in 1765. It was in this historic structure that representatives of the people of Delaware voted on June 15, 1776, for independence from both Pennsylvania and Great Britain, making it Delaware's "Independence Hall." Constructed as one of the oldest active court buildings in the United States, the courthouse continued to serve Delaware as its first state capitol until the government moved to Dover.
