The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation joined America's Tapestry as a Gold-level sponsor in 2020, bringing its unparalleled expertise in early American history and material culture to our project. As the world's largest living history museum, Colonial Williamsburg offers invaluable insights into the textile traditions, craftsmanship, and daily life of America's colonial period.

## Partnership Highlights

Our collaboration with Colonial Williamsburg has enriched America's Tapestry in numerous ways:

- Providing historical consultation on the design and content of the Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina tapestry panels
- Hosting public demonstrations of historical textile techniques by their master craftspeople
- Offering workspace in their textile studio for our Virginia stitching team
- Developing educational materials that connect our tapestries to their living history exhibits

## About the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation

The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation operates the world's largest American history museumâ€”the restored 18th-century capital of Virginia. Here, visitors can step back in time and experience the people, places, and events that helped shape a nation. Through immersive storytelling, authentic period structures, and demonstrations of historic trades and domestic skills, Colonial Williamsburg brings to life the early American experience.

The Foundation's commitment to historical accuracy, craftsmanship, and educational outreach makes it an ideal partner for America's Tapestry, particularly for our work documenting the colonial origins of our nation's diverse cultural heritage.
