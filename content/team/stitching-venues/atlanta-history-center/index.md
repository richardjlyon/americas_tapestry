The Atlanta History Center (AHC) is home to one of the most comprehensive collections of Georgian and Southern history, including extensive archives that document the Revolutionary War period through artifacts, documents, and personal stories.

The center’s expertise in curating engaging historical exhibits and conducting educational programs makes it particularly suited for a project that seeks to educate and inspire through historical narratives.

The center has a strong track record of effectively engaging diverse audiences through its innovative and inclusive approaches to history education. The Atlanta History Center is hosting our embroiderers in their state of the art rotunda.

The AHC also facilitates educational programming, utilizing their well-established platforms and visitor engagement strategies to reach a broad audience.

The Atlanta History Center is hosting our stitchers throughout the year.
