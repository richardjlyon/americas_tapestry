Carol Tewes Ganse retired as a Technical Director/Lead for the National Security Agency where she gained valuable experience in organizing and leading teams to achieve desired outcomes.  She began sewing as a young child and expanded her needlework skills over the years by embroidering, knitting, and crocheting, as well as by making wedding dresses, French jackets, and other items of clothing using couture machine - and hand-sewing techniques. She is a member of the Association of Sewing and Design Professionals, an at-large member of the Embroiderers’ Guild of America, and a Board officer of the Franconia Soaring Foundation. She is currently working towards a Certificate and Diploma in Hand Embroidery from the Royal School of Needlework. Carol enjoys learning about and working with many types of fibers and threads, especially natural fibers such as cotton, silk, linen, and wool.  Her favorite embroidery techniques include Jacobean Crewelwork, Goldwork, and Stumpwork. She is looking forward to working alongside the many talented stitchers who bring a variety of talents and expertise to complete New Hampshire’s tapestry panel.
