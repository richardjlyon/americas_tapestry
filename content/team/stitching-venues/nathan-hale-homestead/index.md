The Nathan Hale Homestead in Coventry, Connecticut, was built by Richard Hale in 1776 on a property he purchased in 1740 to house his large family, including his son Nathan, who was born there in 1755. Nathan Hale, Connecticut's State Hero, became famous as one of America's earliest spies during the Revolutionary War before being captured and hanged by the British in September 1776 at age 21. Located on a 17-acre property that adjoins the 1500-acre Nathan Hale State Forest, the homestead operates as a museum under Connecticut Landmarks, offering tours and educational programming.
