 From the sacrifices of its soldiers to the ideals of its leaders, the Maryland tapestry panel emphasizes the state’s pivotal role in the American Revolution.

At the heart of the image, the bravery of the Maryland 400 is powerfully depicted. This contingent of Maryland soldiers earned their legendary status during the Battle of Brooklyn (also known as the Battle of Long Island) on August 27, 1776. 

Faced with overwhelming British forces, the Marylanders, under the command of Major Mordecai Gist, launched a series of desperate charges against superior British lines, allowing much of General George Washington's Continental Army to escape encirclement and destruction. They defended the Old Stone House in Brooklyn, seen in the background, buying precious time at immense personal cost. 

Accompanying Gist are other notable figures: General William Alexander, Lord Stirling, who led the Marylanders, and a courageous African American soldier, representing the vital but often overlooked contributions of Black individuals to the fight for American independence. 

In the upper right-hand corner, a poignant motif spotlights one of the most significant moments in early American political history: General George Washington's resignation speech at the Annapolis State House in 1783. 

Washington's decision to voluntarily relinquish his military command to the Continental Congress, rather than seizing power, was a revolutionary act that set a crucial precedent for civilian control over the military in the United States. It solidified the principles of a republic, where power resides with the people and their elected representatives, not with military strongmen. 

Standing on the upper balcony, observing this historic event, is Mary “Molly” Rideout. A letter she wrote to her mother vividly captures the emotional gravity of Washington's farewell, underscoring the profound significance of the moment for those who witnessed it.

Dominating the left side of the illustration, the majestic branches of the Wye Oak Tree traverse across the page. This iconic Maryland tree, once the largest white oak in the United States, symbolizes the deep roots of the state's history and its enduring legacy. 

Below its branches, the distinctive rotunda of the Annapolis State House is also featured, an architectural landmark that served as the nation's capital for a period and was the site of numerous pivotal moments, including Washington's resignation.

Finally, in the upper left, the Peggy Stewart ship is depicted, referencing another important pre-Revolutionary event in Maryland. In October 1774, in a parallel to the Boston Tea Party, Annapolis citizens burned the ship along with its cargo of tea to protest British taxation without representation. This act of defiance demonstrated Maryland's commitment to the cause of liberty and its willingness to resist British authority.
