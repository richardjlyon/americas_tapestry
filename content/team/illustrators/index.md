Our Illustrators are the talented artists who create the detailed designs that form the foundation for each tapestry panel. Combining artistic vision with historical research, these professionals work closely with historians, community members, and textile artists to develop designs that capture the essence of America's diverse cultural heritage. 

Their illustrations translate complex historical narratives into visual imagery that can be realized in textile form, balancing aesthetic considerations with the technical requirements of the needlework process.
