 Operated by the National Parks Service, Old Slater Mill tells the story of America’s industrialization. On the banks of the Seekonk River, the Slater Mill is considered America’s first cotton-spinning mill. Built in 1793, the mill complex features the mill, waterwheel, waterway, and a dam established by British born Samuel Slater.
