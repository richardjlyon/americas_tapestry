The Delaware History Museum, operated by the Delaware Historical Society, invites visitors to explore the many stories of the First State and includes the Jane and Littleton Mitchell Center for African American Heritage. The museum is part of the Delaware Historical Society, which was founded in 1864 as an effort to preserve documents from the Civil War and has since grown into a significant statewide historical institution with an extraordinary collection of more than 3 million objects, books, documents, photographs, and maps.
