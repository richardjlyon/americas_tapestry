Sophia Patel specializes in creating the decorative elements and cultural motifs that enrich America's Tapestry panels. With a background in textile design and ethnographic research, Sophia brings a deep understanding of diverse cultural traditions to her work, ensuring that each panel authentically represents the artistic heritage of the communities it depicts.

After studying textile design at the Fashion Institute of Technology and earning a Master's degree in Cultural Anthropology from Columbia University, Sophia worked as a designer for several major textile companies before establishing her own studio focused on culturally-inspired patterns and motifs. Her work has been featured in exhibitions at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum and the Textile Museum in Washington, DC.

For America's Tapestry, Sophia researches traditional patterns and decorative elements from the various cultural groups represented in each state panel. She works with community consultants and cultural organizations to ensure respectful and accurate representation of these traditions, adapting historical motifs for contemporary application while maintaining their cultural integrity.

Sophia's contributions are particularly evident in the border designs and background patterns of the tapestry panels, where she incorporates elements from Native American, European, African, Asian, and Latin American decorative traditions. Her work creates visual connections between diverse cultural influences, highlighting the ways in which America's cultural tapestry has been woven from many different threads.
