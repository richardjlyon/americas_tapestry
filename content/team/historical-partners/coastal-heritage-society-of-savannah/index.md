With their extensive state archives and records of local history, the
Coastal Heritage Society (CHS) is ideally suited to guide the
representation of Georgia’s unique contributions to the Revolution.
Founded in 1975 in Savannah, Georgia, the CHS has a longstanding
commitment to preserving the cultural and architectural heritage of the
coastal Southeast region. This non-profit organization manages several
historically significant sites and museums in Savannah, including the
Savannah History Museum, the Georgia State Railroad Museum, and Old
Fort Jackson, among others.
