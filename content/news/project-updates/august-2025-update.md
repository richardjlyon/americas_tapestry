**Happy August, Everyone!**

I hope everyone is enjoying the final weeks of summertime. How strange it feels that autumn and the beautiful foliage that accompanies the changing season will soon be upon us! Be sure to soak up all the sun's rays while you still can.

As we approach the final stretch of summer, our talented stitchers across all 13 states continue their incredible work. Each panel grows more beautiful with every passing day, and the dedication of our community continues to inspire me. The collaborative spirit that defines America's Tapestry truly embodies the best of what our nation represents.

**What's New?**

All our 13 states have been actively engaged in the fabrication of each panel. Behind every beautiful stitch is a talented embroiderer and a meticulous stitching plan prepared by our fantastic state directors.

Pennsylvania directors **Mary Van Tyne** & **Raven Fagelson** explored many stitch designs to best reflect the artistry of the original illustration by artist **Maggie Weng**. Be sure to examine these images closely to check out all the beautiful techniques used in the different elements of their panel.

**Did you Know?** _Each panel is 35" x 45", or 1,575 square inches. For every square inch of stitching, there is approximately one hour of work. Now that's a lot of hours!_

**From One Coordinator to Another**

This past month I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the **Royal School of Needlework Scotland Stitch Social** in Glasgow, where I had the pleasure of meeting Paula Reynolds, the coordinator of the [Renfrewshire Tapestry](https://qzwbpg.clicks.mlsend.com/ty/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjEyNjQ1MzksXCJsXCI6MTYyMzU1Njc2MzMwMzI5OTA4LFwiclwiOjE2MjM1NTc0ODMzNzA5MjE0MH0iLCJzIjoiYWY4YjUzYjJlNDRmNTE4MyJ9). I even had the opportunity to do a little stitching! Many thanks to the Royal School of Needlework for the invitation and to Carol Ganse for the introduction!

_"We're willing to teach," Theron said, "People come in with no experience. We have fabrics and threading materials to practice with. Stitching should be for everybody."_ - Excerpt from W&M article

**It Takes a Village!**

South Carolina director **Karen Wallach** has been busy with her embroidery team in Clover, SC! Check out their incredible work thus far. These slip stitched motifs are being carefully worked in embroidery hoops before being applied to the completed panel. Incredible work, ladies!

**The Governor Takes a Stitch**

Who says politics and embroidery can't coexist? Delaware directors **Amy Gilley** & **Becky Gutin** traveled with the Delaware panel to the State Fair, where they had a visit from **Governor Matt Meyer** & **Lt. Governor Kyle Evans Gay** who tried their hand at a few stitches. Thank you to both Governor Meyer & Lt. Governor Evans Gay for supporting our project!

**Every Stitch for Every Branch**

New Jersey Co-Director **Carol Prevost** places many careful stitches on an evergreen tree in the tapestry panel in Mt. Holly, NJ. Fabulous work, Carol!

**Stitcher Spotlight: Meet Nancy Cook!**

![](/images/news/2025-08/11.jpg)

Nancy lives in Charlotte, NC and embroiders on the **South Carolina tapestry panel**. An active stitcher for over 50 years, Nancy primarily practices embroidery with **metal threads**, including the beautiful (and challenging!) practice of **goldwork**. This image is an incredible example of her accomplished skill in multimedia projects & raised embroidery. She first learned to embroider in the Brownies program and with the help of her grandmother.

She has used a variety of stitches on the South Carolina panel, including the chain, split, & buttonhole stitch. She joined our project out of friendship and a desire to support embroidery arts. While working on the tapestry, Nancy has learned more about the role of camp followers during the American Revolution. **Thank you for contributing your time and talent, Nancy!**

That's all for now. Thanks for reading and happy stitching,

Stefan Romero

Project Director
