The South Carolina Tapestry celebrates the state's distinctive colonial heritage and its crucial role in the American Revolution. The panel illustrates South Carolina's development from early settlements at Charles Towne to its emergence as a center of rice and indigo cultivation, and its pivotal contributions to American independence through the leadership of figures like Francis Marion, the "Swamp Fox," and the crucial victory at the Battle of Cowpens.

The South Carolina Panel is being created at the [Charleston Museum](/team/historical-partners/#charleston-museum), America's first museum, founded in 1773. Visitors can observe the stitching process and engage with the state's rich history through the museum's extensive collections of decorative arts, textiles, and historical artifacts.

Our South Carolina Director is [Elizabeth Pinckney](/team/state-directors/#elizabeth-pinckney), a textile historian specializing in Lowcountry traditions, who has assembled a diverse team of stitchers from across the state. The panel incorporates techniques that reflect South Carolina's multicultural heritage, including Gullah Geechee textile traditions, European needlework, and designs influenced by the state's Native American communities.

The tapestry highlights key moments in South Carolina's history, from the founding of Charleston to the Revolutionary War battles at Fort Moultrie and Kings Mountain. It also celebrates the state's distinctive architecture, cuisine, and cultural traditions, including the sweetgrass basketry of the Lowcountry and the indigo dyeing techniques introduced by Eliza Lucas Pinckney. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of enslaved Africans to the state's development and the preservation of African cultural traditions in the Gullah Geechee communities.
