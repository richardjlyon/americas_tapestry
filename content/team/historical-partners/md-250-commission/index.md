The Maryland Two Fifty Commission was established in 2023 by Governor Moore to plan the state's commemoration of America's 250th anniversary. The Commission envisions an inclusive and nonpartisan statewide reflection on Maryland's past that honors all Marylanders' contributions, uniting citizens in service and civic engagement to shape the future. Through events, historic site visits, and community involvement, MD Two Fifty invites residents to experience Maryland's rich history and make their own impact through service and civic participation.
