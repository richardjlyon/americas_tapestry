## Techniques Demonstrated

In this 25-minute demonstration, Elizabeth covers several key techniques that were commonly used in colonial American needlework and have been incorporated into the Massachusetts panel:

1. **Stem Stitch**: Used for creating flowing lines and outlines of shapes
2. **Long and Short Stitch**: A shading technique that creates smooth transitions between colors
3. **French Knots**: Used to create textural elements and small details
4. **Chain Stitch**: A versatile stitch used for bold lines and filling areas

Elizabeth also discusses the historical context of these techniques, explaining how they were taught and practiced in colonial America and how they've evolved over time.

## Materials Used

The demonstration uses historically accurate materials similar to those employed in the actual tapestry:

- Linen ground fabric, woven to specifications matching 18th-century examples
- Wool threads dyed with natural plant dyes
- Reproduction wooden embroidery hoops
- Hand-forged steel needles
