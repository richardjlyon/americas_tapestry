# Extend stitcher content.

The goals of this task are:

1. add the stitcher biography in content/team/stitchers/to-add to content/team/stitchers, editing the markdown files with naming and topmatter that is consistent with exisiting ones e.g. content/team/stitchers/alison-haigis/index.md

2. move the images into the correct location at public/images/team/stitchers

3. exend the stitcher model to allow 0, 1 or many images, perhaps via a list topmatter property to named images.

Use serena mcp to analyse code and playwright mcp to verify all updates at http://localhost:3001/team/stitchers
