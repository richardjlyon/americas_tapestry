Historic Odessa is a collection of National Register historic homes all on the site of what was once a thriving grain shipping port and trade hub of the 18th and 19th centuries. Originally named Cantwell's Bridge, the town shipped hundreds of thousands of bushels of wheat and other goods annually from the banks of the Appoquinimink River to Philadelphia, the southern colonies, and across the Atlantic to Europe before declining with the advent of the railroad in 1855. In 1938, Delaware preservationist H. Rodney Sharp purchased Odessa's Corbit mansion (now the Corbit-Sharp House, c. 1774), a National Historic Landmark, beginning a three-decade-long colonial revival of the town's architectural gems.
