The Massachusetts Panel is being created at the [Museum of Fine Arts Boston](/team/historical-partners/#mfa-boston), one of America's oldest and most prestigious cultural institutions. The museum's dedication to preserving American heritage makes it an ideal location for this important work. Visitors can observe the stitching process in the American Wing, where artisans work alongside historical artifacts that inspired elements of the design.

Our Massachusetts Director is [Elizabeth Cunningham](/team/state-directors/#elizabeth-cunningham), a renowned textile conservator and educator at the New England Conservatory of Traditional Arts. Elizabeth has assembled a diverse team of stitchers representing communities from across the Commonwealth, ensuring that multiple perspectives are woven into this historical narrative.
