The Van Schaick Mansion was built in 1755 as the home of Anthony Van Schaick on a section of the "Half Moon" patent originally granted to his father in 1665. This historic brick dwelling served as military headquarters during three major conflicts: the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812. During the Revolutionary War, the mansion functioned as Continental Army headquarters in the months preceding the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, hosting 5,000-10,000 Continental soldiers and their leadership. 

Due to its historic significance, the mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and later designated as part of the New York State Revolutionary War Heritage Trail in 2008. Located in Cohoes, New York, on Van Schaick Island, the mansion stands as one of New York State's most historically significant colonial homes.
