Linda Worrell resides in Clover, SC is an embroiderer on the state panel. Prior to working on the tapestry, Linda worked in surface embroidery. While she has learned many new stitches since joining the project, she has been primarily utilizing a chain stitch throughout her work. Having lived in seven states and Canada, Linda has lived in South Carolina longer than any other location.

She learned about the project through state director Karen Wallach, as they are both members of a local creative inspiration group made up of multidisciplinary artists. The story of a young person joining the Revolution, as is depicted in the South Carolina panel, particularly resonates with Linda. She hopes for peace, unity, and international respect amongst our nation's allies as we look toward to our next 250 years.
