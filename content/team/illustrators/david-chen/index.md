David Chen serves as the lead illustrator for America's Tapestry, creating the detailed designs that form the foundation for each tapestry panel. With a background in both fine art and historical illustration, David brings a unique combination of artistic vision and historical accuracy to his work on the project.

After earning his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and his MFA from the School of Visual Arts, David worked as an illustrator for historical publications and museums, including the National Park Service and the American Museum of Natural History. His illustrations have appeared in numerous books on American history, as well as in exhibitions at major museums across the country.

For America's Tapestry, David works closely with historians, community members, and textile artists to develop designs that capture the essence of each state's cultural heritage. His process begins with extensive research, collecting historical images, documents, and artifacts that represent significant aspects of a state's history. He then creates preliminary sketches that are reviewed by the project's historical advisors and community partners before developing the final designs that will be translated into tapestry.

David's illustrations combine historical realism with symbolic elements, creating compositions that tell complex stories through visual imagery. His work is particularly noted for its attention to detail and its ability to represent diverse cultural perspectives within a unified aesthetic framework.
