# Refactor Safety Testing Guide

## ✅ **Ready for Refactoring!**

You now have a **100% reliable test suite** that will catch fundamental website breakage during refactoring.

## The Command You Need

```bash
npm run test:refactor
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ **10 Jest component tests** - Ensures React components render without crashing
- ✅ **12 Playwright E2E tests** - Ensures pages load and function correctly

**Total: 22 passing tests in ~12 seconds**

## What These Tests Catch

### 🚨 **WILL FAIL if you break:**
- Page routing (404 errors, pages don't load)
- Essential content missing (blank pages)
- Navigation between pages 
- JavaScript runtime errors
- Core page structure (headers, content areas)
- Data loading (tapestries, news, team data)
- Mobile responsiveness basics

### ✅ **WON'T FAIL for cosmetic changes:**
- Color scheme changes
- Font adjustments
- Layout tweaks
- Spacing modifications
- Icon changes
- Dynamic content variations

## Refactoring Workflow

### 1. Before Starting
```bash
npm run test:refactor
```
**Should show: "22 passed"** ✅

### 2. After Each Major Change
```bash
npm run test:refactor
```
- ✅ **"22 passed"** = Safe to continue
- ❌ **"X failed"** = STOP, fix the issue before continuing

### 3. Interpreting Results

**All Green ✅**
```
✓ 12 passed (11.1s)
✓ 10 passed (0.4s)
```
✅ **Your refactoring is safe - website still works**

**Some Red ❌**
```
✗ 2 failed, 10 passed
```
❌ **STOP - You broke something fundamental**

## Test Coverage

### **E2E Tests (Playwright)**
1. ✅ Home page loads and displays core content
2. ✅ All main pages load successfully (About, Tapestries, Team, News, Sponsors, Resources, Contact)
3. ✅ Navigation between pages works
4. ✅ No critical JavaScript errors
5. ✅ Data loading works (tapestries display)
6. ✅ News/blog data loading works
7. ✅ Team data loading works
8. ✅ Contact page loads and has content
9. ✅ Footer contains expected content
10. ✅ Header navigation is consistent across pages
11. ✅ Pages have proper meta information
12. ✅ Mobile responsive - basic functionality

### **Component Tests (Jest)**
1. ✅ Basic React component rendering
2. ✅ React context providers
3. ✅ Layout structure components
4. ✅ Nested component structure
5. ✅ Error boundary handling
6. ✅ Undefined/null props handling
7. ✅ Empty arrays and objects
8. ✅ Form element rendering
9. ✅ Controlled form components
10. ✅ Responsive component props

## Additional Commands

```bash
npm run test:components  # Just Jest tests (fast)
npm run test:e2e        # Just Playwright tests  
npm run test:quick      # Minimal smoke test
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail
1. **Check the error message** - it tells you exactly what broke
2. **Look at the failing test name** - identifies which page/feature is broken
3. **Fix the issue** before continuing refactoring
4. **Re-run tests** to confirm fix

### Common Failures
- **"Page not found"** = Routing is broken
- **"Main element not visible"** = Page structure changed
- **"Navigation failed"** = Links are broken  
- **"Content not found"** = Essential content removed

## Success Criteria

✅ **Before refactoring:** 22/22 tests passing  
✅ **After refactoring:** 22/22 tests passing  
✅ **Website functionality:** Unchanged  
✅ **Time to run:** ~12 seconds
