Allie Pleiter is an embroiderer on the South Carolina tapestry panel. She currently resides in Lake Wylie, SC. Having stitched for only under a year, Allie has accomplished many techniques including pulled or drawn thread embroidery as well as surface embroidery. While working on the state panel, she has utilized daisy, satin, and outline stitches. Out of a desire to join a community of stitchers and to expand her fiber arts knowledge, Allie was inspired to join the America's Tapestry project. While working on the tapestry, she has particularly enjoyed learning about the role of camp followers such as Francis McCord, who is depicted on the South Carolina panel. Looking forward to the next 250 years, Allie hopes we celebrate the important foundations of our democracy.
