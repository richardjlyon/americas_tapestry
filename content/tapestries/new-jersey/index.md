The state design features the many roles New Jersey women undertook
during the Revolution, including raising a phenomenal $15,000 for the
patriot cause. Our historical advisor, [Passaic County Department of
Cultural and Historical
Affairs](https://americastapestry.com/team/historical-partners/#dcha),
conducted a significant amount of research on the fascinating lives of
those living in the Dey Mansion in Passaic County. Famously, the Dey
Family hosted Generals Lafayette and Washington at the Mansion in 1780.

The lower right hand vignette features a smallpox innoculation administered by 
Senior Surgeon of the Continental Army Dr. Bodo Otto. Dr. Otto was tasked with
establishing a military hospital in Trenton, New Jersey, specifically to inoculate
troops against smallpox. This initiative was critical in safeguarding the health of
soldier during a time when disease posed a severe threat to military effectiveness. 

Our New Jersey Directors are Carol Prevost and Kiki Haumann. The stitching
will be conducted by members of the Colonial West Jersey EGA Chapter in
partnership with the Princeton EGA Chapter.
