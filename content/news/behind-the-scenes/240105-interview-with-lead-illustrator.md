# Behind the Design: Interview with Lead Illustrator David Chen

In this behind-the-scenes feature, we sit down with David Chen, the lead illustrator for America's Tapestry, to learn more about his creative process and the challenges of designing historically accurate yet visually compelling tapestry panels.

## From Concept to Canvas

**Q: David, can you walk us through your process for designing a new tapestry panel?**

A: Each panel begins with extensive research. I typically spend several weeks immersed in historical documents, photographs, artwork, and scholarly texts about the state and its cultural heritage. I also consult with local historians, community leaders, and the state directors to identify the key stories and elements that should be included.

Once I have a solid understanding of the historical material, I create a series of thumbnail sketches exploring different compositional approaches. These early sketches help me determine how to organize the various elements chronologically and thematically.

After selecting the most promising composition, I develop a more detailed sketch that I share with our historical advisors and community partners for feedback. This collaborative review process is crucial—it ensures that we're representing diverse perspectives accurately and respectfully.

The final design is created as a full-color illustration at exactly the same size as the finished tapestry. This becomes the template that our stitchers work from, so it needs to include precise details about colors, textures, and stitching techniques.

## Balancing History and Artistry

**Q: How do you balance historical accuracy with artistic expression?**

A: That's one of the most fascinating challenges of this project. We're creating artwork that needs to be historically accurate, visually compelling, and technically feasible for our stitchers to execute.

I often use symbolic imagery and visual metaphors to represent complex historical concepts. For example, in the Massachusetts panel, I incorporated a tree with roots extending through different historical periods to represent how early ideas about liberty and education continue to influence the state's identity today.

I also draw inspiration from period-appropriate artistic styles. The colonial sections might echo the composition and color palette of 18th-century folk art, while sections depicting the industrial revolution might reference the aesthetic of vintage advertisements or WPA murals.

The goal is to create a cohesive visual narrative that feels authentic to each historical period while still functioning as a unified artwork.

## Technical Considerations

**Q: What special considerations do you need to keep in mind when designing for embroidery?**

A: Designing for embroidery is very different from creating illustrations for print or digital media. I need to consider the limitations and possibilities of the medium—what can be achieved with thread that can't be done with paint, and vice versa.

I work closely with master embroiderers to understand which stitching techniques will best represent different textures and details. For example, satin stitch creates smooth, solid areas of color, while French knots can create wonderful textural effects for elements like tree foliage or rocky landscapes.

I also need to consider the scale of details. Something that looks simple in a drawing might be extremely complex to execute in thread, so I'm constantly balancing detail with practicality.

Color is another important consideration. We use historically accurate natural dyes for many sections of the tapestries, which have a more limited palette than modern synthetic dyes. I need to design with these color constraints in mind.

## Personal Connection

**Q: Do you have a personal favorite among the panels you've designed so far?**

A: That's like asking a parent to choose a favorite child! Each panel has been a unique journey and has special elements that I'm proud of. But if I had to choose, I might say the Virginia panel, which was particularly challenging because it needed to represent such diverse landscapes, cultures, and historical periods—from indigenous communities to colonial settlements to the American Revolution.

I'm also especially connected to the New York panel, as that's where I grew up. Incorporating my personal memories and experiences of the state's cultural landscape into the design was deeply meaningful.

## Looking Ahead

**Q: What are you working on now, and what can we look forward to seeing next?**

A: I'm currently finalizing the design for the Texas panel, which has been a fascinating exploration of the state's complex multicultural history. The panel includes elements representing indigenous communities, Spanish colonization, Mexican heritage, German and Czech immigration, and the diverse contemporary population.

After that, I'll be starting work on the Illinois panel, which will focus on the state's role in American transportation, agriculture, and cultural movements. I'm particularly excited about representing Chicago's architectural innovations and rich musical traditions.

Long-term, I'm looking forward to the challenge of the Alaska panel, which will require extensive research into indigenous artistic traditions that are less familiar to me. I'll be working closely with Native Alaskan artists and cultural consultants to ensure respectful and accurate representation.
