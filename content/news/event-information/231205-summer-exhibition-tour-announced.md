# America's Tapestry Announces Summer 2024 Exhibition Tour

We are thrilled to announce that America's Tapestry will be embarking on its first major exhibition tour during Summer 2024, bringing our growing collection of completed panels to museums and cultural centers across the country. This tour represents an exciting opportunity for communities nationwide to engage with this monumental collaborative artwork and the diverse American stories it tells.

## Tour Schedule

The exhibition will visit five major cities, with each venue offering unique programming and educational opportunities:

### National Museum of American History, Washington, DC
**June 1-30, 2024**

The tour kicks off at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, where visitors will see the tapestries displayed alongside historical artifacts that relate to the stories depicted in each panel. Special programming will include talks by historians who consulted on the project and demonstrations by master embroiderers.

### The Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL
**August 15-September 8, 2024**

In Chicago, the exhibition will be complemented by a series of workshops exploring the intersection of traditional craft and contemporary art. Local fiber artists will lead sessions on adapting historical techniques for modern expression.

### Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA
**September 20-October 15, 2024**

The Boston exhibition will highlight the Massachusetts panel and the contributions of the Boston Embroidery Guild. Special tours will explore connections between America's Tapestry and historical textiles in the museum's collection, including colonial-era samplers and quilts.

### High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA
**October 25-November 20, 2024**

The tour concludes in Atlanta, where programming will focus on the Georgia panel's depiction of diverse communities that have shaped the South. Community story-gathering sessions will collect narratives for potential inclusion in future panels.

## Exhibition Features

Each venue will display the completed state panels—Massachusetts, Virginia, Georgia, New York, and others—along with preliminary designs for upcoming panels and documentation of the creation process. Interactive elements will include:

- Touchable sample panels demonstrating various embroidery techniques
- Video interviews with stitchers, historians, and community members
- Digital kiosks allowing visitors to zoom in on high-resolution images of each panel
- Activity stations where visitors can try basic stitching techniques
- Community quilting frames where visitors can contribute stitches to a collaborative project

## Educational Programming

A comprehensive educational program has been developed to accompany the exhibition, with resources for K-12 teachers, homeschool groups, and adult learners. Curriculum materials connecting the tapestries to American history, art, and cultural studies will be available for download from our website beginning in March 2024.

"This tour represents an important milestone for America's Tapestry," says Jane Doe, Project Director. "While the project will continue for several more years, we're excited to share our progress with communities across the country and to gather new stories and perspectives that will inform our ongoing work."

## Tickets and Information

Most venues will include the exhibition with general admission, though some special programs may require separate registration. For detailed information about tickets, hours, and venue-specific programming, please visit our website or contact the individual museums.

We hope you'll join us for this celebration of America's diverse cultural heritage and the revival of traditional textile arts as a medium for community storytelling.
