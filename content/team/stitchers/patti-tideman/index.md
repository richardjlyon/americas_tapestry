Patti Tideman is an embroiderer on the New Jersey tapestry panel. A resident of Morristown, she has been stitching for over 50 years. Having learn embroidery through courses available at her church, Patti has practiced beading, cross stitch, canvaswork, counted work, and surface embroidery, among others. While working on the panel, Patti has utilized brick stitch and couching stitch, as well as the darning stitch - a new technique for her! Patti can trace her family's heritage back to William Brewster, a passenger on the Mayflower and a senior elder of the Plymouth Colony. Passionate about historical projects, Patti has enjoyed working on America's Tapestry and has learned much more about Dr. Bodo Otto and the practice of inoculation in colonial America.
