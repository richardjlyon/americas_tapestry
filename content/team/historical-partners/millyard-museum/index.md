Located in the heart of Manchester, New Hampshire, the Millyard Museum is a dynamic institution dedicated to preserving and sharing the city’s rich history. Operated by the Manchester Historic Association, the museum is housed in a renovated mill building of the historic Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, once the centerpiece of Manchester’s booming textile industry. 
In addition to its permanent and rotating exhibits, the Millyard Museum offers educational programs, community events, and hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. The museum also features the Discovery Gallery, a flexible space for family programs, lectures, and temporary exhibits. The adjoining MHA Research Center houses a vast archive of documents, photographs, and artifacts, supporting ongoing research and historic preservation efforts. 

The Millyard Museum hosts our New Hampshire embroiderers under the leadership of Carol Ganse and Michelle McPheron.
