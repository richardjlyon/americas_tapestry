**Greetings, Everyone!**

The month of May is upon us! In light of the prodigious April showers, I hope you are all savoring the
spring blossoms that this month inevitably brings.

**What's New?**

12 of the 13 panels are now in production. How exciting is that? As your state commences embroidery or is in the
preparatory phase, please reach out with any questions you may have. **Please note**, email rather than phone or text is best this month!

**Behind the Stitches**

As many of you know, I hand trace each of the designs onto linen using a massive light board. This process can take between 4 - 8 hours depending on the complexity of the design. I used a Frixxon heat activated pen, allowing for any lines to be removed with light steam or heat. Many a podcast was listened to as the hours went by!

Early in April, I visited the Georgia Tapestry at the Atlanta History Center. Robin & Dorothy were busy at work - it was
phenomenal to see the progress they have made in just one month's time.

Last weekend I had the honor of attending EGA's MET Gala in Montvale, New Jersey. Stitchers from
New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut gathered to join one another as they worked on various individual stitching projects.

Also in attendance was the New York Tapestry Panel, led by Jenni Paperman of the Capitol District EGA Chapter in Albany.
What a thrill it was to watch as the inaugural stitch occurred! We cannot wait to watch their progress over the next months as they stitch at the Van Schaick Mansion.

**Sponsorship Announcement!**

I am so thrilled to announce an exciting new sponsorship with California-based Fleur De Paris, a needlepoint distributor. Established in 1975, the company has built an exceptional reputation as a wholesale distributor and importer of premium-quality materials for cross-stitching, knitting, crochet, embroidery, and other needlework crafts. They will be generously supplying our embroiderers with
specialty flosses that will enhance each stitch design.

**We've Gone Viral!**

Well, almost! Be sure to follow & share our Facebook & Instagram pages to keep up to date with recent developments. I have been crafting 90 second videos to document each state's progress as they begin stitching. Have a look!

The Pennsylvania Tapestry team has created their own Instagram account - why not give them a follow? Their handle is: @americastapestry.pa

Thinking about creating a social media account for your state panel? Go for it!

**May Spotlight: North Carolina**

This month we are thrilled to spotlight the North Carolina Panel, illustrated by Kacy Momon, a first year art student at Savannah
College of Art & Design.

The panel honors the Edenton Tea Party, a significant moment early in the Revolutionary movement.

Momon's illustration depicts a group of women gathered outside the Chowan County Courthouse in 1774 debating and discussing a
document symbolizing their political resolve. The event is considered one of the earliest recorded instances of organized political actions by women in the American colonies.

The Edenton Tea Party was organized by Penelope Barker and involved 51 women who signed a resolution to boycott British goods including
tea and textiles. This act was in protest of the Tea Act of 1773 and other oppressive measures imposed by the British Crown. The women
pledged their support for the resolutions passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress, which aimed to resist British taxation
without representation.

The resolution, known as the "Edenton Resolves," declared the women's commitment to abstain from British imports until unjust
laws were repealed. It emphasized their duty to protect the "safety and happiness" of their country and demonstrated their solidarity
with broader colonial resistance efforts.

While ridiculed in England through satirical cartoons, the Edenton Tea Party was celebrated in the colonies as an act of patriotism. These women not
only supported the revolutionary cause but placed themselves at great risk by political asserting their political agency.

The panel will be stitched under the leadership of Gail Smith in historic sites across North Carolina, thanks to our partnership
with the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

**What's Next?**

Let the stitching commence! No doubt there will be logistical concerns to iron out as the process gets started. Be sure to share
and send photos to inspire and motivate our other states!

That's all for now. Thanks for reading and happy stitching!
