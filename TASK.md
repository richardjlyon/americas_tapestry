# Modal popup

This feature introduces a modal pop-up to allow us to direct the user's attention to new information. The content will be spectified in content/popup/index.md. The popup will appear over the main index page. A cookie will be set to ensure that the popup is not shown on subsequent visits to minimise annoyance.
