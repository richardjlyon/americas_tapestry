Susan is an embroiderer on the South Carolina panel of America's Tapestry. She resides on Lake Wylie, SC. While having previously embroidered, Susan has not stitched for 30 years! Much of her previous work included smocking and cross stitching. Since working on the tapestry, Susan has used the chain stitch, blanket stitch, satin, and a weaving stitch. Having grown up in Ohio, she has learned a great deal about the American Revolution since joining our project, including the heroism of Francis Salvador. Looking forward another 250 years, Susan hopes that all US citizens treasure our history and will continue to value our unique patchwork of beliefs, locations, and futures.
