The Connecticut Tapestry celebrates the state's foundational role in American governance and its rich cultural and industrial heritage. Known as "The Constitution State" for the Fundamental Orders of 1639—considered by many to be America's first written constitution—Connecticut's panel depicts its Puritan origins, its contribution to the Revolutionary War, and its transformation through maritime trade and industrial innovation.

The Connecticut Panel is being created at the [Connecticut Historical Society](/team/historical-partners/#connecticut-historical-society) in Hartford, where visitors can observe the stitching process and engage with the state's history. The society's extensive collection of historical textiles, including samplers, quilts, and clothing, has provided valuable reference material for the design and techniques used in the panel.

Our Connecticut Director is [Margaret Hollister](/team/state-directors/#margaret-hollister), a textile conservator and historian who has assembled a team of stitchers representing communities from across the state. The panel incorporates traditional New England needlework techniques, including crewel embroidery and whitework that would have been familiar to colonial Connecticut women.

The tapestry highlights key moments in Connecticut's history, from the founding of the Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield colonies to the Charter Oak incident, the state's contribution of soldiers and supplies to the Continental Army, and its later industrial innovations in clock making, firearms manufacturing, and submarine construction. Special attention has been paid to representing the contributions of the Pequot and Mohegan peoples, African Americans, and immigrant communities to Connecticut's development.
